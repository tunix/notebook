My notes about everything

## Why?

I'm not happy with any of the existing note taking solutions as

* they're mostly ugly
* they're mostly not cross platform
* they mostly use web based interfaces
* they're way more complicated than my needs

I need simple, markdown based note taking where I just write stuff and then commit to somewhere.

This is my effort to keep things simple and easy. Inspired by [Azer's notebook](https://github.com/azer/notebook).
